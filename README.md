I really love "creating," that is, translating my ideas into visible form.
And when what you do proves useful and valuable to the people around you, I feel a sense of satisfaction and meaning in life.

## my pet projects:

### [widget «ICS Display Board»]

Developed a lightweight GUI widget on PyQt for displaying online calendar data in real-time 24/7. The project is designed for use in theaters, replacing paper schedules with digital displays, thereby saving time and resources. The application works with public calendars in .ics format, filters the data, and displays it in a convenient format. It can be easily deployed on a Raspberry Pi and supports flexible settings through a user interface.

### [telegram Bot «ZazhiBot»]

Developed the "ZazhiBot" Telegram bot using aiogram as part of the social project "Zazhivoe" ("Yeltsin Center", Yekaterinburg), aimed at de-stigmatizing people with mental differences through creative interaction. The project used real communication data from participants to create a unique user experience, demonstrating the communication features with neurodiverse individuals.

### [telegram Bot «English Self-Check Bot»]

Developed a Telegram bot on aiogram for self-checking learned English phrases. The bot allows users to add and check phrases and expressions in English, supports text and audio input, two modes of checking (regular and spontaneous), and an intuitive interface with inline keyboard. The project also includes user management, request limits, and data storage using SQLite or PostgreSQL.

### [desktop App «Simple Video Converter»]

Developed a desktop application for video file conversion using ffmpeg and a graphical interface on customtkinter. The program allows users to quickly and easily convert videos to popular formats, choose the compression level, and rotate videos, minimizing user interaction with the command line.
